# Nigeria_Superstore_Analysis-and-Profit-prediction
This project is about A Nigeria superstore profit analysis and I also use different models to predict if there will be profit or loss. 
# Data
I used Nigeria superstore dataset for analysis and prediction.
# Environment and tools
1. Jupyter notebook
2. Numpy
3. Pandas
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn
I chose different models to prefict if there with be profit or loss and RandomForestClassifier perform better with accuracy of 94.65%.
# Outcome of analysis
From the analysis from the Dataset I recommend the following solution to generate more profit for the store:
1. we have to limit our discount from 0% to 10%.
2. we have to increase sales of that product which comes under technology category.
3. we have to increase sales of that product which comes under copiers sub-category.
4. Tables,Bookcases, supplies from sub-category generate loss so we have to reduced sales from them.
5. we have to choose home office segment to generate more profit.
6. Quantity of items should be in between 1 to 11.
7. central region generate very less profit so we have to reduce our sales operation in central region and increase our sales in west region.
8. there are 10 state that generate loss so we have to reduce our sales operation in these state.
9. there are 10 state that generate most profit we can increase sales in those states.
